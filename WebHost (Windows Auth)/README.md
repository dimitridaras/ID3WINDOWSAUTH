Identity Server plus Windows Auth
======================================

This code demonstrates how to protect a web API using Identity Server 3 plus Windows Authentication. All of the code is taken from the Identity server 3 samples page. I have just put the bits together and written a walkthrough for beginners like me.

I am happy to accept comments and pull requests.
